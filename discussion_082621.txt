External: Determine which species are inactivated (assume dC/dt ~= 0)

1) Reduce which Fun() elements get calculated
2) Reduce which Jac_SP() elements get calculated
3) Reduce which KppSOlve() elements get calulated

4) Cancel jacobian row/col - set them to zero
4.1) Compact the sparse data to remove those zeros

Questions:
1) Where to start?
-- First you all need to interpret and understand the "compressor"
-- -- ... this will (start to) define the parts of the problem (See below).

2) What is an ideal test mechanism?
-- CH3 & OH (slow & fast)

3) Who is doing the work?
-- Daniel would prefer Haipeng lead (at least on manuscript writing).
-- I don't want to lose the ability to get hours.

4) What are the parts of the problem?

Papers:
1) KPP v3 - update to Sandu & Sander
2) Application & performance of mech redux/compact in GC
... if
3) Generic ML interfaces that can be fed directly to KPP
